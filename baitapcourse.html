            <h2>First up, we have level-1 for those who know absolute nothing about protein.</h2>
            <p>Now, let me show you what those proteins actually are...And that is plant-based protein</p>
            <p>And i'm basing these ratings on a 100g serving.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Firm Tofu: 6.8g of protein(1/10).Its actually pretty low, i'm not a big fan of this one.</li>
                <li>Tempeh: 16.1g protein(3.5/10).Its somewhere in the middle.</li>
                <li>Seitan: 21.2g protein(5.2/10).Pretty high.</li>
                <li>Textured Vegetable Protein: 42.5g protein(6/10).</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The reason i don't rate plant-based protein highly is that they contain incomplete amino acids; however, it's perfectly fine if you're a vegetarian.</p>

            <h2>Moving on to the next level: Level-2(Egg & Dairy) - The Convenience Kings</h2>
            <p>These are the flexible proteins. Great for snacks or adding a boost to your main meals. But if you have a lactose allergy or are a lactose intolerant, i wouldn't recommend this to you.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Milk: 3.5g protein(2/10). Basically water with a bit of protein. Don't rely on this.</li>
                <li>Cottage Cheese: 11g protein(6/10). Great slow-digesting protein (casein) for nighttime.</li>
                <li>Greek Yogurt: 10g protein(6.5/10). Low calorie-to-protein ratio. Easy to crush a big bowl.</li>
                <li>Hard Cheese(Parmesan/Cheddar): 25g protein(5/10). Massive protein, but the fat content is a trap. Be careful.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>And now...Meet the temple's gatekeepers. They may stand at the entrance, but they pack way more minerals than the ones deep within the shrine: Level-3:Seafood - Lean and Mean from the Ocean</h2>
            <p>If you want protein without the heavy feeling of red meat, this is your zone. Plus, you get those Omega-3s.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Shrimp: 21g protein(6.5/10). Good, but you have to eat a lot of them to hit your goals.</li>
                <li>Cod/Trout: 22g protein(7/10). Very light, great for cutting phases.</li>
                <li>Salmon: 25g protein(7.5/10). High protein, but high calorie due to healthy fats. Use wisely.</li>
                <li>Canned Tuna: 26g protein(9/10). Pure protein. It's cheap, convenient, and incredibly effective.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>And here they are: the throne holders, the kings who shall never be overthrown...Level-4: Meat & Poultry - The Heavy Hitters</h2>
            <p>Moving up from plant-based, we have the animal kingdom. These are complete proteins, meaning they hit all the essential amino acids your muscles crave.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Beef (Lean cuts): 24.5g protein (7/10). Solid choice, but the saturated fat keeps it from a higher rank.</li>
                <li>Bison/Venison: 26g protein (8/10). Leaner and meaner than beef. Excellent for clean bulking.</li>
                <li>Chicken Breast: 28g protein (8.5/10). The GOAT for a reason. High protein, almost zero fat.</li>
                <li>Turkey Breast: 30g protein (9/10). Even leaner than chicken. It's the ultimate protein cheat code.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Protein helps you  jacked, but other nutrients are just a crucial. If protein is the one on the throne, then carbs, fat, and fiber are the ones who balance the kingdom and help it stable.</h2>
